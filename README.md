Moral versions of the Daw and Kool two-step tasks

This code has been written by <b>Stephanie Campbell</b>, based on code by Wouter Kool.

These directories contain the code for running the doors-and-buttons versions of the Daw and Kool two-step paradigms online.

Both experiments have been written using Josh deLeeuw's jsPsych toolbox (http://www.jspsych.org/).

In order to save the data, you will need to be able to connect to a SQL database on your server. The code has some default names for the tables it stores data in (e.g., shockgame_daw_data, shockgame_daw_subinfo, shockgame_daw_subid), but feel free to change anything about the way the data storage is managed.
